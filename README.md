# The Impact of Climate Change on Mountain Gorillas

## Overview
This project analyzes how climate change affects mountain gorilla stress levels and habitat use. The goal is to provide insights that support conservation efforts for this critically endangered species.

## Dataset
The analysis uses datasets containing gorilla stress indicators (cortisol levels), habitat data, and environmental variables including temperature and greenhouse gas emissions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Note that the data is not region-specific within the DRC, which introduces some limitations.

## Tools & Technologies
- R and RMarkdown for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting

## Methods
Data cleaning involved removing irrelevant or missing data, including assumptions about missing reproductive state data. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to explore relationships between temperature, cortisol levels, habitat use, and greenhouse gas emissions.

## Key Findings
- There is a strong positive correlation between temperature and gorilla cortisol levels, indicating higher stress with rising temperatures.  
- Changes in environmental conditions appear to influence gorilla foraging and habitat use.  
- Projected greenhouse gas emissions in the DRC are expected to rise steadily over the next decade, potentially increasing stress on gorilla populations.  
- These findings highlight the urgent need to address climate change and protect gorilla habitats.

## Limitations
- Missing data in some variables may have affected results.  
- Lack of region-specific environmental data limits precision.  
- The analysis may oversimplify complex ecological interactions.

## Deliverables
- Analysis and report in RMarkdown format  
- Visualizations supporting the studyâ€™s conclusions  

## Purpose
To inform conservation strategies by understanding how climate change impacts mountain gorilla stress and habitat use, supporting efforts to preserve this endangered species.
